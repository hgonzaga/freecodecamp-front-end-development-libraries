# jQuery

My solution proposals for the [jQuery](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries#jquery)
exercises.

freeCodeCamp module description:
> *"jQuery is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in the world. In 2006 when it was released, all major
browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently. jQuery simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript, and
also ensured that your code worked the same way in all browsers. In this course, you'll learn how to use jQuery to
select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page."*
