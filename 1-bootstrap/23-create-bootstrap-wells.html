<!--
Create Bootstrap Wells
Bootstrap has a class called well that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns.

Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.

- You should add a div element with the class well inside each of your div elements with the class col-xs-6
- Both of your div elements with the class col-xs-6 should be nested within your div element with the class row.
- All your div elements should have closing tags.
