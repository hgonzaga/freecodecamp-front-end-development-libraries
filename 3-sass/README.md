# SASS

My solution proposals for the [SASS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries#sass)
exercises.

freeCodeCamp module description:
> *"Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects. In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more."*
